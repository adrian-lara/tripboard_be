I swear that there's an inverse correlation between amount paid and actual knowledge/skill when it comes to certain jobs, and the rangers sure don't get paid well, to say the least. \nThe scenery is incredible. You will honestly leave with a new view of nature and the world. I have never had to pick my jaw up off the ground more than my days at this National Park (let's all pray my girlfriend never reads this).\nJust remember to talk to the rangers if you're a novice. Ask questions. A lot of questions. AND LISTEN TO THEM. The difference between a bear up in your business and a good night's rest is as simple as making sure you listen to what the rangers have to say. \nEvery time I remember my adventures here, it makes me want to come back even more, and I'm already begging for the summer so I can finally run away again deep within the mountains. \nI could never recommend a nature destination more than the Rocky Mountain National Park. It completely changed my Illinois-born perspective of life and nature.",
